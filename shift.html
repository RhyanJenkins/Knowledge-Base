        <h3>Abandoned Vehicles</h3>
        <p>-If on CCTV, verify that vehicle is still there and add note in history of event. Keep watching and update event accurately until vehicle has cleared. You can advise HERO that you have this abandoned vehicle on camera and they do not need to stop if HERO has already marked vehicle.
            <br>
            <br>
            <div id="indent">
            -If not on CCTV, verify with HERO if vehicle is still on scene and still abandoned.
            <br>
            *Be advised, HERO only patrols IH-35 on weekends. If you work weekends and have an abandoned vehicle on another route, make a note in the event history that HERO is unable to check on vehicle on weekends due to HERO only patrolling IH-35. Monday morning all vehicles should be checked on all routes.</div>
            <br>
            <p>
            If vehicle has been verified on scene for 48 hours, the appropriate law enforcement agency must be notified of abandoned vehicle. When calling obtain:
                <ul id="shifts">
                    <li>Case number, if available.</li>
            
                    <li>Operator spoken to.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
                    <p>Add a note in the event history of this information.</p>                
             
            <p>
            If vehicle is still on scene after another 48 hours, call LE agency back and ask for update. Again, obtain the operator of who you spoke to and add another note in event history. Do so until vehicle has cleared.
            </p>
