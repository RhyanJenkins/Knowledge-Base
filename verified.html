    <p style="text-align: center"><mark>If you receive a call from a not-verified source, but then you find it on CCTV, event will be verified by CCTV.</mark><br></p>
        <br>
        <p>Example:<br> Citizen calls in disabled vehicle. Found on camera. <br>Notified will be by Citizen, verified will be by CCTV. <br>Make sure you add a snapshot!</p><br>
        <h2>Why is it Verified?</h2>
        <p><u>Law Enforcement</u> is verified when they are on scene, due to them being a reliable source that have eyes on the scene. They are able to provide information, if needed.</p>
        <p><u>CTRMA</u> is a verified source due to their being a TMC like us. They have cameras and patrollers also monitoring roadways. They are able to provide information, if needed.</p>
        <p><u>CCTV</u> is a verified source because our cameras are real time. What we see on camera is actually occurring.</p>
        <p><u>HERO</u> is a verified source if the patrol operator is on scene. They will provide all information needed directly to us. If not on scene, they are not verified. See below.</p>
        <h2>Why is it NOT verified</h2>
        <div id="indent">
        <p>A <u>citizens</u> information is not verified for multiple reasons:            
            <br>
            -Often times a citizen is not sure of their location. They could say they’re on the frontage road of a highway, but really they are on a side street just OFF of the roadway.
            <br>
            <br>
            -Some citizens don’t know what is considered a frontage road compared to a freeway. They may say they’re on the freeway, but really be on the frontage road.
            <br>
            <br>
            -They might already have someone coming to assist them, and by the time HERO arrives in the area, they have already cleared.
        </div>
        </p>
        <p><u>311</u> is not verified because they receive most of their information from citizen callers.</p>
        <br>
        <div id="indent">
        <p><u>Law Enforcement</u>, when not on scene, is not verified for multiple reasons:
            <br>
            -Often a LE officer will have dispatch call in a vehicle that they just drove past. They only had eyes on it once, and then left. By the time HERO arrives, often times the vehicle has already driven off and cleared the scene.
            <br>
            <br>
            -LE might call it in to HERO before LE is on scene. But before HERO arrives, LE arrived first and cleared the scene.</p>
            </div>
            <p><u>TMC Operator</u> is not verified, unless the motorist in need of assistance is actually the TMC Operator. Often times an operator will call in an event that they drove past. This is not verified due to the TMC operator not being on scene and having eyes on the actual events. By the time HERO arrives, the scene might have cleared already.</p>
            <p><u>System Alarm</u> is not verified due to it coming from an LE agency. Some event area linked between LE and the system alarm. They provide us with location and some information about an event that either is active, or an event that has already cleared. Due to the inconsistency of the system alarm, we only put in events with the system alarm if we can verify them with a verified source. <br><br>For example: The system alarm states there is a collision IH-35 and Braker Lane. Use the CCTV to look for the collision. If you can’t find it, it has most likely already cleared, or it’s in a different location than what the alarm actually states. Sometimes the alarm states a block number for a freeway, but really they mean that it’s in a parking lot in that area at that exact location.</p>
            <p><u>HERO</u> is NOT verified. ONLY IF HERO sees the event while driving and has not arrived yet.
                <br>
                <br>
                Example: Sometimes HERO will state that on the opposite side of the highway he sees an event. He will advise the location and a brief description, but advise that he is en route. If event has LE on scene, or if event is found on CCTV before HERO arrives, then it will be verified by whichever source. If no LE and unable to locate on CCTV the event will stay NOT verified until HERO arrives on scene. The event will be opened as a New Unplanned Event, and HERO will be added as dispatched. Place a note in the history that HERO spotted the event while on the other side of the roadway, and it is not yet verified.
